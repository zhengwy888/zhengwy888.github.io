title: Moto G Connectivity problem with Netgear Router
---
<p>i had one wifi network that was set up with<br>WPA2(AES), b/g/n mixed mode.<br>Moto G was able to recognize the network, but upon punching in the correct key, Android just complains 'Failed to connect to network'<br>Turns out some how if you turn the Netgear router setting page, 'WAN setting' -&gt; set 'NAT filter' to 'open', everything works beautifully.<br>Netgear WTH?</p>
